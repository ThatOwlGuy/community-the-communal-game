A communal paintball fan game

There's a dev branch now. Always change dev before master.

Video walkthrough of the rules: https://youtu.be/v2h3TdQfDYs (Required to be watched before you use this repo)

## Rules

### 1. Never Push To Master
If you are not colead or a github manager, you should never be pushing changes you make to master.
### 2. Never Work on Master
No work should ever be done on the master branch, and no branches should be made off of master. The only branch that should be attached to master is the development branch.
### 3. Never Work on Development
You can't work on development either. But if I can't work on master or development branch, how can I develop? Check rule number 4
### 4. ALWAYS branch off of development
If you have a feature you want to work on, or if you want to try out something with the latest project. Make a new branch named with your task off of development (EX: readmeUpdate, editLayout..).
### 5. ONLY merge between development and task branches
This is where all the work happens. you see that there needs to be noise on paintball splatters, you look at the repo and create a new branch off of development called "splatNoise". You get it working and want it to be in the project. We'll check over your work. Get another programmers to test your branch and voila! You can merge "splatNoise" into development. Now everyone can hear those sick paintball splashes.
