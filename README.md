There's a dev branch now. Always change dev before master.

## Rules

### 1. Never Push To Master
If you are not colead or a github manager, you should never be pushing changes you make to master.
### 2. Never Work on Master
No work should ever be done on the master branch, and no branches should be made off of master. The only branch that should be attached to master is the development branch.
### 3. Never Work on Development
